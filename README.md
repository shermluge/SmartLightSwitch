Attiny85 Smart light switch

This switch uses multiple sensorsor (see schematics). I built this for my wife who loves to sit quietly and croshet while watching TV.
Since the sensors are PIR, capacitence (radar), sound, any trigger will turn on for a very short time. But it will keep adding time while sensors are being triggered up to a max defined time. So if false it will trigger for a short amount.

*Possible changes: I might change it to the ignoring first trigger in case it is false.
